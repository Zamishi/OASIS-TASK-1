# ATM Interface System
The ATM System is a Java-based application developed in Spring Tool Suite (STS) that simulates the core functionalities of a real-world ATM. This project provides users with an intuitive interface to manage their bank transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and checking account balances.

Key Features:
Deposit Functionality:

Users can deposit money into their account by specifying the amount they wish to add. The system updates the account balance accordingly and provides a confirmation message after each successful transaction.
Withdraw Functionality:

The system allows users to withdraw money from their account, checking the current balance to ensure sufficient funds are available. If the balance is insufficient, the system notifies the user and prevents the transaction, ensuring account integrity.
Transfer Functionality:

Users can transfer funds to other accounts by entering the receiving account details and the amount to be transferred. The system validates the balance and updates both the sender's and receiver's accounts, providing a detailed transaction history.
Display Balance:

The system includes a feature to display the current balance, allowing users to view their available funds at any time. This functionality helps users keep track of their account status and manage their finances effectively.
Transaction History:

For enhanced user experience, the ATM system maintains a history of all transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Users can review their recent activities to monitor their spending and account actions.
Technical Details:
Development Environment: Java, developed in Spring Tool Suite (STS).
User Interface: Console-based interaction that provides a straightforward, menu-driven experience for users to select desired actions.
Backend Logic: Uses Java collections and control flow mechanisms to manage account data and transaction processing efficiently.
